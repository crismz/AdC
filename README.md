Arquitectura de Computadoras

* LAB1 involves developing SystemVerilog code to describe sequential and combinational circuits using the QUARTUS tool.
* LAB2 involves using a simulation tool to analyze the performance of a microprocessor with different microarchitectures. Analyze how variations in cache sizes and characteristics, as well as branch predictors, impact the microprocessor's performance. Compare the performance of an in-order execution microprocessor to an out-of-order one.
